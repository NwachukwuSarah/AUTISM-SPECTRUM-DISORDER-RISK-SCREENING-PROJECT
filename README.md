**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

Developed a machine learning-based web application to predict the risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children, adolescents, and adults using responses from the AQ-10 screening questionnaire.

The project utilized AQ-10 behavioral assessment questions along with additional demographic and medical features such as sex, family history of ASD, and history of neonatal jaundice.

The workflow included comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. Multiple models were tested and optimized to achieve reliable classification performance.

The final model was deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input screening responses and receive real-time ASD risk predictions.
